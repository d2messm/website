                                    <li>Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity both for its flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical piperine, not to be confused with the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning and is often paired with salt</li>
                                    <li>Classification- Dicotyledons</li>
                                    <li>Runner shoots from high yielding and healthy vines are kept coiled on wooden pegs fixed at the base of the vine to prevent the shoots from coming in contact with soil and striking roots. The runner shoots are separated from the vine.</li>
                                    <li>Picking \ Ripening- . The runner shoots of pepper plant are separated from the vine during February-March. The fruit is dried up to obtain black pepper as final product.</li>
                                    <li>Pepper and Peppercorn Storage can be sealed in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place up to one year. Some sources claim that properly stored, sealed peppercorns can still be viable up to three years.</li>
                                    <li>Consumption- Black peppers are also used typically as a counterirritant for pain. The black pepper market is directly influenced by the growing processed food industry. The rise in consumption of bakery products, confectionery products, and ready-to-eat and ried food in the developed economies is driving the market for the spice.</li>
