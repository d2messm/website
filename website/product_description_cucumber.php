                                    <li>Category: Gourd Family, Cucurbitaceae.</li>
                                    <li>Cucumbers are native to India. Cucumber is the climbing plant of the gourd family which yields cucumbers, native to the Chinese Himalayan region. It is widely cultivated but very rare in the wild.</li>
                                    <li>Breeding/Production-  Cucumber produce both male and female flowers on the same plant. Male flowers appear on the main stem earlier and in much larger numbers than female flowers. They are climber plants.</li>
                                    <li>Varieties- There are three main varieties of cucumber: slicing, pickling, and seedless.</li>
                                    <li>Storage- Wrap the cucumber in plastic wrap. Keeping the cucumber wrapped minimizes the amount of moisture on the cucumber, which slows the process of decay. After wrapping, the cucumber should be refrigerated which in-turn keeps it cold enough to stay fresh for one week to 10 days.</li>
                                    <li>Consumption- Cucumberâ€™s skin contain insoluble fiber, which helps add bulk to your stool. This helps food to move through your digestive tract more quickly for healthy elimination. Cucumbers are very low in calories, yet they make a filling snack (one cup of sliced cucumber contains just 16 calories).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p> Fiber and water-rich vegetables like cucumbers can boost your mouth's saliva production, which in turn helps wash away the bacteria that cause the odor in the mouth. Cucumber is one of the main components of raw salad. It is also very useful in weight loss.</p>
