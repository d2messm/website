                            <p>Onion, also known as the bulb onion or common onion, provide important nutrients and health-promoting phytochemicals. High in vitamin C, onions are a good source of dietary fiber, and folic acid. They also contain calcium, iron, and have a high protein quality. Onions are low in sodium and contain no fat. Onions emit a very sharp flavor and fragrance once fried. This is due to the sulphur compound present in the vegetable. They contain a number of antioxidant compounds that are very effective in neutralizing the free radicals present in the human body. </p>

                                    <li>Definition- Onion is a vegetable which is almost a staple food in India. It is one of the raw ingredients of salads. They are available in wide varieties of colors like white, red or yellow.</li>
                                    <li>Classification- Dicotyledons</li>
                                    <li>Breeding/Production- Onions should be grown on friable soils, which contain high amounts of organic matter and have good water-infiltration rates and good moisture-holding capacity.</li>
                                    <li>Variety- Bulbing of onions is primarily induced by photoperiod or day-length. Onions are classified by skin color (red, white, brown, or yellow), taste (sweet or pungent), and shape of the bulb (round, flat, or globe).</li>
                                    <li>Picking/Ripening- Onions are usually harvested when one-third to one-half of the tops have fallen over. Bulbs are generally pulled from the soil after being loosened with a disk. They are then topped approximately 1 inch above the bulb. To prevent rot organisms from entering the bulb, onions must be adequately cured (drying of the cut top or neck area) in the field, in open shade, or by artificial means before being placed in storage. Curing may require two to four weeks, depending on weather conditions.</li>
                                    <li>Consumption- The average annual onion consumption calculates to approximately 6.2 kilograms of onions per person across the world.</li>
                                    <li>Storage-Onions should be stored in a cool, dry, ventilated place, away from direct sunlight. Do not store whole onions in plastic bags. Chopped or sliced onions can be stored in a sealed container in your refrigerator for up to 7 days.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p>Onions have many possible health benefits including reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and cancer. Incorporating onions into a diet is very simple, with a versatile range of ways they can be prepared and cooked in regular foods. Adding onion is a great way to add flavor to a dish without adding extra calories, fat, or sodium.</p>
