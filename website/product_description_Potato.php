                            <p>The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum.
                                Potato may be applied to both the plant and the edible tuber. Raw potato is 79% water, 17%
                                carbohydrates (88% of which is starch), 2% protein, contains negligible fat. In 100 grams,
                                raw potato provides 322 kilojoules (77 kilocalories) and is a rich source of vitamin B6 and
                                vitamin C (23% and 24% of the Daily Value, respectively), with no other nutrients in significant amount. </p>

                                    <li>Breeding/Production- Potatoes are generally grown from seed potatoes, tubers specifically grown to be free from disease and to provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes are grown should be selected with care.</li>

                                    <li>Their flowers, appearing on the apical meristem, have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style. Flowers in domestic cultivars can be self-fertilizing. The flowers are 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme of three to 12 together</li>
                                    <li>Additional features: Lightweight design with central carry handle for convenience and 3 cutting height settings</li>
                                    <li>Tomatoes that have been modified using genetic engineering have been developed, and although none are commercially available now, they have been in the past.</li>
                                    <li>The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars. A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 5-10-10 is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer, although manure and compost are also used.</li>

                                <p>To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with ethylene.[66] Unripe tomatoes are firm. As they ripen they soften until reaching the ripe state where they are red or orange in color and slightly soft to the touch.[citation needed] Ethylene is a hydrocarbon gas that many fruits produce, which acts as the molecular cue to begin the ripening process. Tomatoes ripened in this way tend to keep longer, but have poorer flavor and a mealier, starchier texture than tomatoes ripened on the plant.[citation needed] They may be recognized by their color, which is more pink or orange than the other ripe tomatoes' deep red, depending on variety.</p>
